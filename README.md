# ecumene

This is a tiny, toy clone of mapnik.  It only supports ESRI Shapefiles, and not much else.
This was written for my own learning.

By "clone", I don't mean that it is a port or a rewrite.  It is my own independent attempt to create images based on open streetmap data using an input config file similar (but somewhat different) to [Mapnik configuration XML](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/XMLConfigReference).
There are some similarities in the naming conventions due to the similarities in the input format, but otherwise I'd not consider it a derivative.

## what's in a name

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumene): 

    The ecumene (US) or oecumene (UK; Greek: οἰκουμένη, oikouménē, lit. "inhabited") was 
    an ancient Greek term for the known world, the inhabited world, or the habitable world.

This is my own attempt to draw pretty maps of the known world.
